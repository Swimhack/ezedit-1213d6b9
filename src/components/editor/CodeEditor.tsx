// This is a placeholder for the actual CodeEditor component
// Since we don't have access to modify it directly, you'll need to 
// check if it accepts an editorRef prop and modify it accordingly.
// If not, we'll need to update the CodeEditorPane to not pass this prop.

// Here's how we might expect the interface to look:
/*
interface CodeEditorProps {
  content: string;
  language: string;
  onChange: (value: string | undefined) => void;
  editorRef?: React.MutableRefObject<any>;
}
*/

// Since we can't modify this file directly, we need to check if the CodeEditor
// component accepts the editorRef prop or adapt our usage in CodeEditorPane
